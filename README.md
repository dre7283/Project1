## Task

We have developed a three country currency exchange converter. This convertor uses the following requirements:
* Use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap.
* Be deployed to GitHub Pages.
* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).
* Use at least two [server-side APIs](https://coding-boot-camp.github.io/full-stack/apis/api-resources).
* Does not use alerts, confirms, or prompts (use modals).
* Use client-side storage to store persistent data.
* Be responsive.
* Have a polished UI.
* Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).
* Have a quality README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

* US Dollar (USD
*  Canadian Dollar (CAD)
*  Australian Dollar (AUD)

The user will enter the dollar amount to be converted, select the From and To options, and finally click Get Exchange Rate Button.

Once the user clicks Get Exchange Rate the converted rate will display above the button.
We have also supplied a Search history feature that shows previous amounts converted which is stored in local storage

There is no limit to the number of searches stored and displayed.  The user can clear the history displayed by clicking the button Clear History.  This will remove the Search History section from the screen.
